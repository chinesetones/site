It's easy to want to ignore tones when beginners first start out with Chinese.

After all, Chinese is already challenging enough with its thousands of characters. Surely we can put those pesky little diacritical marks aside for now?

That'd be a HUGE mistake.

Chinese is a tonal language, which means that tones are an integral part of any word. Use the wrong tone, and a word can take on a totally different meaning!

**Two-word pairs** are especially difficult. You not only have to remember the tone of each word, but you also have to combine both words into a phrase, AND say it in a natural manner. Make a mistake at any step of the way, and your speaking partner might think you are using a completely different phrase.

Here are five pairs of two-word phrases for you to practice, accompanied by example sentences. Each pair of phrases has the same syllables, but are pronounced with different tones.

I hope this helps!
