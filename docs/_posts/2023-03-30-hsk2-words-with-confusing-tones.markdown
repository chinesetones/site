One particularly tricky thing about HSK 2 (and Chinese in general): there are many words with the same syllable but different tones that could trip you up.

For example, can you tell the difference in pronounciation between the 白 in 白色 and the 百 in 百万? Both are written as "bei" in pinyin, but they have different tones (2nd vs 3rd tones) and completely different meanings. (And to make things even more confusing, the chinese charactes also look almost the same...)

If you don't speak a tone-based language, you'll want to pay special attention to these words, and practice their tones.

I've combed through the *entire list of HSK 2 vocabulary* to pick out **17 groups of similar-sounding words**. For each group, I've included an **example sentence** so you can learn to hear the difference in tones in context.

Let's dive in!
