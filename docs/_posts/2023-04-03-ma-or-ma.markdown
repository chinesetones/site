The syllable "ma" is commonly used to explain the four Chinese tones to beginners, because ma can either mean mother, numb, horse or scold, depending on which of the four tones is used.

Here's a guide to each variation of "ma", complete with audio examples. See if you can recognize and hear the difference! Practice saying the words after you listen to the audio.
