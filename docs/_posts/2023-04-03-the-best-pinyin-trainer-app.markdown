So you're learning Mandarin Chinese? 

First off, kudos for starting — Chinese is no walk in the park. The US State Department rates it as a Category IV language, which means it's "exceptionally difficult for English speakers."

This is the highest classification available for languages, and **Chinese shares this notorious label with Arabic, Japanese and Korean.**

(The easiest languages to learn? Spanish, French and Italian — now you understand why so many English speakers claim to speak those languages — they're just way easier to learn.)

Now, perhaps you can understand why Chinese, Arabic, Japanese and Korean all share the most difficult label — their writing systems are pretty much incomprehensible to any native English speaker.

But what makes Chinese EVEN harder than Arabic, Japanese and Korean is that it contains tones!

For example, if you say mā (mother 妈) with the wrong tone, you might end up referring to your mom as a horse (mǎ 马)! 

**Chinese Characters + Tones = a HUGE barrier to many learners.**

There are already a variety of mobile apps available to help you memorize characters, but not a ton for helping you with tones. And here's where the Ka app shines: we're simply the [best pinyin trainer app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ka-chinese-tones-learn-pinyin/id6444140899) to help you master the tone system. 

**Pinyin is the standard romanization system for Mandarin Chinese.** If you want to learn Chinese, you'll have to master pinyin, and Ka is perfect for helping you do that. 

When you use Ka, you'll gain exposure to a wide variety of sounds and syllables in Chinese. The app contains thousands of audio recordings and features a fun, gamified interface. You'll find yourself tapping and swiping cards and breezing through levels while getting repeated listening and recognition practice in. 

Best of all, you can use the app for free (of course, if you find it valuable, please do consider purchasing an optional in-app purchase; however, you can still use the app for free if you don't want to make a a purchase)
