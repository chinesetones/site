The best way to memorize Chinese tones is to treat each tone as part of the word. Whenever you learn a new word, remember three pieces of information: how to write the characters, what they mean, and what they sound like.

For example, the word 高兴 (gāoxìng; happy).

The **three pieces of information** you'll need to remember are: (1) the characters 高兴; (2) its meaning, which is "happy; and (3) the sound of this word.

<table>
<tr>
<td>(1) Characters</td>
<td>(2) Meaning</td>
<td>(3) Sound</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>高兴</td>
<td>happy</td>
<td>{% include embed-audio.html src="/assets/audio/hsk1-tone-pairs/高兴.mp3" %}</td>
</tr>
</table>

Press the play button to hear the sound for 高兴. 

For the sound, it's critical to **hear it repeatedly** and commit it to memory. 

Do not just try to memorize the pinyin dacritic marks gāoxìng! It's never going to work as well as memorizing the actual sound. 

You need to memorize the AUDIO representation of the word in Chinese, not the VISUAL representation of the word in Pinyin.

The pinyin is just an aid to help you get to the right tone. Ultimately, what matters is how the word sounds like, not how it is written in pinyin.

And you remember the sound by listening to it repeatedly!

An easy, effective way to help you commit the sounds of various Chinese characters to memory is the [Ka Chinese tones app](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6444140899?pt=117273943&ct=web&mt=8).
