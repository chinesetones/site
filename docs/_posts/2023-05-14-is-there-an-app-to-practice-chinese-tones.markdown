Perhaps you've just started learning Mandarin Chinese. 

Or maybe you already have some experience with it and are looking to improve further.

Inevitably, there comes a time when you'll tear your hair out in frustration over one of the central features of the Chinese language — tones.

Yes, those pesky little diācrítìc mǎrks.

No matter how hard you try, they just seem like a black box you can't ever crack.

Did I just accidentally call my mom (mā) a horse (mǎ)? 

Was that Chinese person talking about being hurt (shāng hài) or going to Shanghai (shàng hǎi)?

After a series of repeated linguistic embarrassments, you might start to wonder: 

**Is there an app to practice Chinese tones?**

The answer is a resounding **yes!**

## An app for tone practice

I built [Ka](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6444140899?pt=117273943&ct=web&mt=8), an app that can help you learn and practice Mandarin Chinese tones. With Ka, you'll learn to recognize the difference between tones, stop mixing up words and start speaking pitch-perfect Chinese.

The app is built to **feel like a game**. It has over a hundred levels, and you'll find yourself swiping and breezing through bite-sized tone practice exercises whilst collecting fun things and upgrading your dragon mascot.

Use it for just a few minutes a day, but keep at it. By the time you reach the final stages of the app, you'll have achieved completely mastery in tones. Very soon, all your pinyin-related struggles will feel like a thing of the past.

With its engaging games and exercises, Ka makes learning tones feel like a fun challenge rather than a tedious task.

Whether you're just starting out or looking to improve your existing skills, Ka is a fantastic tool for mastering Mandarin Chinese tones. 

Best of all, Ka is **free**!

## How is Ka free?

From the beginning, I knew it was important to keep the app free for folks who can't afford to pay — such as students in school. It's important to keep education as accessible as possible.

Thus, I stuck to a central premise — all the content in Ka, all 100+ levels of it, is completely free and not behind a paywall. 

But of course, as an independent developer (this is **my job**), I needed a way to sustain my business.

The central way I make money from Ka is via a paid **subscription**. You start off with 5 lives, and lose one every time you get a card wrong. If you subscribe, you'll get unlimited lives, as well as a bunch of other features — such as removing all ads from the app.

But **even if you choose not to subscribe, you can still the app for free.** You can simply wait a few hours for your lives to be restored, or start a practice session (practice doesn't use up lives).

So why not **[give it a try and take your Chinese to the next level?](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6444140899?pt=117273943&ct=web&mt=8)**

## What about Android?

Many people have written to me asking when the app will be available on Android via the Google Play Store.

Unfortunately, I'm a team of just one person, so I can't do everything right away!

I do plan to release an Android version, but the honest truth is, it's quite a huge endeavor, and it's probably going to take a while — making an app for a different platform is equivalent to re-writing all the code again!

If you would like to be notified when an Android version is released, please enter your email on [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf1xW4xmLRo2cNiEY_6wWMWsCTU6xW7mESpKsC52ea64lvLBA/viewform?usp=send_form). I promise you'll be the first to know when I release an Android version :)
