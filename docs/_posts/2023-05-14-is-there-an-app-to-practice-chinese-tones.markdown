Perhaps you've just started learning Mandarin Chinese. 

Or maybe you already have some experience with it and are looking to improve further.

Inevitably, there comes a time when you'll tear your hair out in frustration over one of the central features of the Chinese language — tones.

Yes, those pesky little diācrítìc mǎrks.

No matter how hard you try, they just seem like a black box you can't ever crack.

Did I just accidentally call my mom (mā) a horse (mǎ)? 

Was that Chinese person talking about being hurt (shāng hài) or going to Shanghai (shàng hǎi)?

After a series of repeated linguistic embarrassments, you might start to wonder: 

**Is there an app to practice Chinese tones?**

The answer is yes. [Ka](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6444140899?pt=117273943&ct=web&mt=8) is an app that can help you learn and practice Mandarin Chinese tones. With Ka, you'll learn to recognize the difference between tones, stop mixing up words and start speaking pitch-perfect Chinese.

The app is built to **feel like a game**. It has over a hundred levels, and you'll find yourself swiping and breezing through bite-sized tone practice exercises whilst collecting fun things and upgrading your dragon mascot.

Use it for just a few minutes a day, but keep at it. By the time you reach the final stages of the app, you'll have achieved completely mastery in tones. Very soon, all your pinyin-related struggles will feel like a thing of the past.

Best of all, Ka is **free**. With its engaging games and exercises, Ka makes learning tones feel like a fun challenge rather than a tedious task.
