### A painless and effective way to master Chinese tones. ###

Ka is a fun, fast-paced flashcards game that introduces you to the range of different sounds that make up the Chinese language and gives you plenty of listening and pronunciation practice via quick, snappy drills. 

It is available on the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ka-chinese-tones-learn-pinyin/id6444140899) for download on iPhone and iPad.

[Is there an Android version?](https://forms.gle/YnYYtbzV5qixa52J6)

### Ka is built by Kai. ###

My name is Kai. I'm an independent software developer based in Seattle. 

I grew up speaking both English and Chinese in Singapore.

I developed this app because I saw that many Chinese learners were struggling with tones. It's one of the toughest things about the language to learn.

The reason the app is named Ka has nothing to do with my own name (though Ka and Kai both sound similar).

Ka (Âç°) actually means card in Chinese. If you give the app a try, you'll see that swipeable cards feature prominently in its design. I thought that this could be a fun form factor to make learning pinyin and tones less painful.

I've spent many hours building and polishing Ka. I hope it helps you out.

If you enjoy it, I would appreciate an App Store review! Every rating counts, especially for a new app.
