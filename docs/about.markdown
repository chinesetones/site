My name is Kai. I'm an independent software developer based in Seattle. 

I'm originally from Singapore, and grew up speaking both English and Chinese.

I developed Ka because I saw that many Chinese learners were struggling with tones. It's one of the toughest things about the language to learn, and I've witnessed even advanced speakers getting tripped up by it.

I thought that swipeable cards could be a fun form factor to make learning pinyin and tones less painful.

I've spent many hours building and polishing Ka. I hope it helps you out.

If you enjoy it, I would appreciate an App Store review! Every rating counts, especially for a new app.
